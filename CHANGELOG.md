# CHANGELOG

## February 28, 2025
The changelog fell behind for awhile but Marinus has had continuous improvements since the last entry. These changes include:
* Migration of the web server to ECMAScript Modules (ESM). This allowed all of the packages to be updated to the latest version and should make it forward compatible for the future.
* New support for recording account information with DNS records.
* Added support for stage environments and a dedicated http_only a flag.
* Performance improvements on database queries such as IP insertions.
* SECURITY: Improvements to the web server for handling array URL parameters and tightened regex matching. The sameSite flag was changed from 'none' to 'lax'.
* A large number of other miscellaneous bug fixes and minor improvements.


## September 18, 2019
* The scripts have been updated to leverage Python logging. This allows more control of the output levels of the scripts. In addition, the new format adds line numbers and timestamps to the output. Please see the python3_cron_scripts/README.md file for more information.


## August 18, 2019
* Added support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to the REST API and the website UI.


## August 12, 2019
* Added Marinus create and update dates to new certificate transparency database entries for tracking when Marinus first recorded the entries. A new API allows users to search the logs based on the Marinus update or create dates. This allows users to limit their API queries to only the certificates that have been recently added or modified within Marinus. The Marinus creation dates reflect when the Marinus tool began tracking the certificate which is different than the certificate's creation date which reflects when the certificate was first generated by the certificate authority.


## July 26, 2019
* Added support for OWASP Amass version 3.


## June 13, 2019
* Added the ability to upload collection information to a Splunk index. Some organizations may want to correlate information from Marinus with other data in their Splunk logs. In addition, some organizations may to take advantage of Splunk dashboards for dynamic charting of Marinus information. The new script will upload HTTP headers collected from Zgrab scans. However, the script can be altered to upload whatever data is relevant to your organization. The script uploads the data to an HEC using the "_json" format.


## April 10, 2019
* As a parallel to the all_dns collection, an all_ips collection has been created. This collection centralizes all IPv4 and IPv6 information into a single collection. The data is de-duplicated and references to local resources are not recorded. This collection can be particularly useful if you obtaining data from internal resources and/or have a large number of IP addresses that do not have a corresponding DNS record. In this case, the code assumes that internal data comes from a Splunk resource but the code could be easily customized to whatever is relevant for your organization.
* Marinus now collects Google Cloud Compute public IP ranges.


## March 11, 2019
* The website UI has been simplified to be completely based on Boostrap, jQuery, and Octicons.


## March 7, 2019
* Splunk libraries and a script template have been added. Some organizations store useful information in Splunk that could be correlated with Marinus. Unfortunately, the way that the data is stored and indexed would vary between organizations. As a compromise, Marinus provides libraries for accessing Splunk. However, unlike other Marinus code, the get_splunk_data.py script would need code contributed by the user in order to be run. The file is only a template containing sample code for using the Splunk libraries.
* The API for fetching internal domain references within TLS certificates has been updated to allow for retrieving the count.
* Send_remote_server now has flags to allow uploading of individual collections.
* The Sonar scripts will not automatically create the directories that are needed.
* A reference to the most recent Common Crawl graph has been added to to common_crawl_graph.py
* The CA path in the Infoblox libraries have been updated to reflect more recent paths.
* The nginx configuration files have been updated to reflect more recent options.
* Several bugs have been found and fixed. 


## February 19, 2019
* The original ZGrab utility has been deprecated by the project owners. Therefore, Marinus has been updated to support the new ZGrab 2.0 version. The schemas between the two versions are not compatible and support for the new schemas has been added. Marinus will now support both versions but it defaults to version 2.0. The version can be specified in the env.js file on the web server. New command line parameters will inform the relevant Python scripts.
* Many WHOIS records now redact the owner details for privacy. This makes it difficult to determine the owner of a domain name based on the organizational value. To address part of this problem, support has been added to validate that the name server values within the WHOIS record belong to your organization. The setup.py script can be used to add the DNS addresses for your organization's name servers. These values can then be used by the mark_expired script to ensure that your organization still controls the domain.
* There have been important bug fixes added to the new certificate code and whois_lookups code.


## February 7, 2019
* Modified the get_original_ct_logs, get_crt_sh, and download_facebook_certs scripts to start recording the zones associated with the certificate. This will make it easier to search the ct_certs collection for root domains.


## February 6, 2019
* The get_owasp_amass script adds support to import DNS data from the OWASP Amass tool. Amass is similar to Marinus and supports a few more data sources than Marinus. Rather than duplicating existing Amass functionality, Marinus now supports running and importing the results from Amass searches. The OWASP Amass GitHub page provides information on how to install the tool: https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/
* In order to decrease the chances of script failures due to database connection issues, support was added to handle pymongo AutoReconnect exceptions for the find queries in a few selected libraries. As Marinus progresses, this will expand to a more complete implementation.


## February 5, 2019
* PTR records are now added to the all_dns collection when RDNS records are identified in Sonar.
* A few bug fixes and touch ups.


## February 4, 2019
* The Python 2 versions of hash_based_upload and download_* were removed.
* A Python 3 X509 certificate parser was added to separate the certificate parsing from the hash_based_upload script.
* The get_original_ct_logs Python 3 script was added as a replacement for the Python 2 download_* and hash_based_upload scripts. It is more performant over time than the Python 2 scripts because it only queries new certs since the last run. The script does not require the Google Certificate Transparency project, it works with any Version 1 CT Log, and performs more thorough searching of zones. Saving of certificates to disk is now optional.
* A get_crt_sh script was created to allow for querying the crt.sh service for additional certificates. Saving certificates to disk is optional.
* A Python 3 Jobs Manager library was created to standardize job tracking.
